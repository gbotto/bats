This is the code for a classification algorithm for bat species identification from echolocation pulses in Uruguay. 
This work was performed by a research group from the Universidad de la República (UdelaR) 
and the Program for Conservation of Bats from Uruguay (PCMU).
The development of the algorithm is subject of a paper in proccess of publication:
